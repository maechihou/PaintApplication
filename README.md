# Paint Application

### What the program does
This is a simple paint application I developed using C# and Windows Forms. It allows users to draw on a canvas with different brush sizes and colours, and also includes an eraser feature. The application supports undo and redo functionality, and also provides keyboard shortcuts for these two operations.

### Features
- Drawing on a canvas with different brush sizes and colours
* Eraser feature to erase drawn content.
+ Undo and Redo functionality to undo or redo drawing actions
- Keyboard shortcuts for undo and redo operations (Ctrl+Z for undo, Ctrl+Y for redo)
* Customizable brush sizes
+ Customizable pen colours
- Save/Create new drawing
* Visual feedback for selected brush size and colour.

### Dependencies
The Paint Application is built using C# and the .NET Framework


### Bugs and known issues:
- Undo must be pressed two times for one undo
* Redo must be pressed two times for one redo
